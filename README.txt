PicViewerWPF(PWPF)

The purpose of this project is to make a better windows photo viewer (WPV).

WPV does not work across multiple directories, does not allow for random viewing and does not do gif animations.

PWPF will display pictures across multiple directories but does not do gif animations yet.

PWPF does not support multithreading since there is nothing to do while a new set is being made. Hopefully the progress bar will be useful.

See the Todo List for what needs to be done.
